# **Comparative Study: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) vs Classical Algorithms**

## Comparing PQC Schemes with Classical Algorithms : 

<ins>Key Size:</ins> The amount of data (in bytes or bits) required to represent the public key and private key of a cryptographic algorithm.

<ins>Signature/ciphertext sizes:</ins> For digital signatures, itâ€™s the amount of data attached to a message to prove authenticity.<br />
For encryption (KEMs), the ciphertext size is the data sent to convey the encrypted secret.

<ins>Execution Time:</ins>The time or number of CPU cycles required for key generation, encryption/decryption, or signing/verification.
